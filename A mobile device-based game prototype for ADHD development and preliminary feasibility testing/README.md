# A mobile device-based game prototype for ADHD development and preliminary feasibility testing
Abstract:<br>
This research aimed to devise and assess a mobile game therapy software for children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), as well as evaluating its suitability and effectiveness in improving the cognitive ability of typically developing children. The study encompassed 55 children diagnosed with ADHD and 55 neurotypical children. Initial assessments involved ADHD-related scales, computerized tests for information processing, and physiological-psychological evaluations. After a 4-week home-based game intervention, participants underwent re-evaluation using baseline measures and provided feedback on treatment satisfaction. Considering the small proportion of study participants who dropped out, data was analyzed using both the Intention-to-Treat (ITT) analysis and the Per-protocol (PP) analysis. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT06181747). In ITT analysis, post-intervention analysis using linear mixed models indicated that the ADHD group improved significantly more than the neurotypical group particularly in Continuous Performance Test (CPT) accuracy (B = −23.92, p < 0.001) and reaction time (B = 86.08, p < 0.01), along with enhancements in anti-saccade (B = −10.65, p < 0.05) and delayed-saccade tasks (B = 0.34, p < 0.05). A reduction in parent-rated SNAP-IV scores was also observed (B = 0.43, p < 0.01). In PP analysis, paired-sample t-tests suggested that the ADHD group had significant changes pre- and post-intervention, in terms of CPT Accuracy (t = −7.62, p < 0.01), Anti-saccade task Correct Rate (t = −3.90, p < 0.01) and SNAP-IV scores (t = −4,64, p < 0.01). However, no significant changes post-intervention were observed in the neurotypical group. Survey feedback highlighted a strong interest in the games across both groups, though ADHD participants found the game more challenging. Parents of ADHD children reported perceived benefits and a willingness to continue the game therapy, unlike the neurotypical group’s parents. The findings advocated for the integration of serious video games as a complementary tool in ADHD treatment strategies, demonstrating the potential to augment attentional abilities and alleviate clinical symptoms. However, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) is needed to further verify its efficacy.
