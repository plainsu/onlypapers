# Localization of International Affective Digitized Sounds and intercultural preliminary comparison in College Students<br>
Abstract:<br>
Background:Auditory stimulus (i.e. sounds) played a significant role in eliciting and recovering emotions. As research on the relation between sound and emotion continues to advance, the International Affective Digitized Sound-2 (IADS-2) was developed as a set of standardized sound stimuli to promote standardization and reproducibility of emotion research. However, there are several issues with research based on the IADS-2. First, previous researches have primarily focused on rating dimensional indicators such as valence, arousal, and dominance, which overlooks the qualitative differences of emotions. While emotion classification theory categorizes emotions into distinct basic emotions, it could refine our understanding of emotions induced by different sounds. The second issue is the lack of localization research on Chinese groups, which limited the generalization of previous findings to the Chinese population and the comparison of emotional responses with other cultural groups. Therefore, our study aimed to localize the IADS-2 in the Chinese population with a combination of emotional dimension indicators and basic emotion indicators to expand the use of the IADS-2.<br>
Procedures: A total of 167 Chinese university students rated the emotional indicators of the sounds in the IADS-2 using a 9-point self-report rating scale. The average age of the participants was 21.04 years (SD = 1.879, range: 18-30 years), with 81 males (48.8%) and 85 females (51.2%). The emotional indicators included valence, arousal, dominance, happy, angry, sad, fear, surprise, and disgusting. Each participant rated 55-56 sounds, with each sound receiving ratings from at least 66 participants. During the experiment, each sound was presented for 6 seconds, and participants had up to 5 seconds to rate each emotional indicator. Before the formal experiment began, we first used three non-IADS-2 sounds to practice with the participants to ensure that they were familiar with the procedure before the formal experiment began. The entire experimental procedure took approximately 30-40 minutes. We then categorized these sounds according to these indicators and further analyzed the differences in emotional responses of different semantic categories of sounds , and explored the relation between valence, arousal, and dominance. Finally, we consulted publicly available databases of IADS-2 ratings from other countries (The United States of America, Portugal, Japan, South Korea) and compared the differences in emotional ratings of various types of sounds across cultures.<br>
Results:Our study obtained the emotional ratings of Chinese university students for various sounds in IADS-2. The results recorded nine emotional indicators of each sound. We found a cross-cultural U-shaped relationship between valence and arousal, and a positive linear correlation between valence and dominance. Additionally, different semantic categories of sounds elicited different emotional response in Chinese population. Music and electric sounds could induce the highest valence, dominance and happy emotions, natural sounds could induce the lowest arousal, while the breaking sounds always induced the highest negative emotions and the lowest positive emotions. Finally, we found cross-cultural differences in emotional ratings of sports, video games, music, erotic sounds and threatening sounds. Compared to other cultures, the Chinese population exhibited higher arousal levels towards high valence sounds such as sports, video games, and music, and they exhibited lower arousal levels to threatening sounds such as fighting, screaming. Erotic sounds demonstrated pronounced cultural differences between East and West, with Eastern cultures (China, Japan, and South Korea) perceiving these sounds negatively and Western cultures (The United States of America and Portugal) perceiving them positively.<br>
Conclusions:To sum up, our study localized the IADS-2 to Chinese culture, which not only expanded the applicability of the IADS-2 but also provided more refined materials for subsequent emotion research and interventions based on Chinese culture. We also drew some preliminary conclusions through our research and proposed some cross-cultural differences, which provided reference for further research.<br>
# 基于中国江苏大学生群体的国际情绪数字声音库的本土化与文化间初步对比
摘要：<br>
随着声音与情绪关系研究的不断推进,对声音标准化的需求日益增加。已有研究者建立了国际情绪数字声音库（International Affective Digitized Sounds, IADS）,但缺乏中国本土化。研究采用IADS-2声音库,结合情绪维度与基本情绪分类指标,探索中国大学生对各种声音的情绪评分。研究收集了166名大学生对不同声音的评分数据,对声音分类并分析不同语义类别声音的情绪反应差异,计算情绪维度的相关性,并进行跨文化比较。结果显示,不同语义类别的声音存在情绪反应差异;效价与唤醒之间呈U型关系,效价与主导性之间呈正线性相关。体育、电子游戏、音乐、情色和威胁性声音的情绪反应存在文化间差异。总的来说,研究通过对IADS-2进行本土化提供了初步结论,有待进一步研究检验。
